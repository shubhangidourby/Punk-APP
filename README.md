# Punk-APP
Start command: npm start

Key Features:

•	Search Bar: Implement a search bar to allow users to search for beers. The search should trigger a request to the Punk API to retrieve beers that match the query.

•	Infinite Scrolling: As the user scrolls down, more beers should load dynamically, creating an infinite scroll effect.

•	Beer Card Component: Create a card for each beer. The card should be split into two sections: Left Side - Display an image of the beer; Right Side - Show details of the beer (I.e name and description). If you can make the card UI better then you can think on your own how to adjust the image, name and the description part in the card.

•	Favorite Feature: Each beer card should include an option (like a star icon or button) to mark the beer as a favorite. Utilize local storage to save and retrieve the user's favorite beers. Ensure that the state of the favorite beers persists even after the browser is refreshed.

•	Favorites Page: Implement a separate page or view to display the user's favorite beers. Provide an option to remove beers from the favorites list.
